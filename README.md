## Description

This challenge asked me to refactor the codebase to follow accessibility standards and uses semantic html elements.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Tasks accomplished
